# BenkoTIPS - Identity Session

In the today's crazy world of exploits, hacker tricks and rapidly changing landscape of technology tools and techniques, choosing the right identity and access management solution is critical for securing applications and providing seamless user experiences. With so many options to choose from, like Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Easy Auth, Keycloak, IdentityServer, Okta, among others, it can be challenging to determine the best fit for your application's needs. How do they work? How are they different? Where did they come from and how do I pick the right one? In this session we will explore the options, demo how they work, and discuss how to make the right choice for your application.
